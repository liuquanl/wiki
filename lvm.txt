There are 3 concepts that LVM manages:

    Volume Groups
    Physical Volumes
    Logical Volumes 
    
Once you have your LVM partition, you need to initialize it as a Physical Volume. Assuming this partition is /dev/sda1:

sudo pvcreate /dev/sda1

sudo vgcreate foo /dev/sda1

lvcreate -n bar -L 5g foo 

lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv

resize2fs /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv
